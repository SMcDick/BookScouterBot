# BookScouterBot
BookScouter.com is a book buyback aggregator which searches multipule websites to help you find the best price for your book. However, the price of the book you are trying to sell can flucuate (e.g. a book that sells for $0 in January could sell for $23 in March). Manually typing in the ISBNs of all the books you want to sell is a tedious and time-consuming process so I have written a bot which reads the ISBNs from a file and returns the available offers.
